# Experiment 1: Fixation task

This branch containes the script and resources to programme Experiment 1 of Slim and Hartsuiker's paper *Moving visual world experiments online? 
A web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Ducyk (2017) using PCIbex and WebGazer.js*. This experiment is a brief fixation task. On each trial, a fixation cross appears on one of thirteen positions on the screen for 1500 ms. The participants are instructed to fixate on each fixation cross untill it disappears. The WebGazer.js algorithm is used to estimate the position of the participants' gazes (Papoutsaki et al., 2016). 

The experiment is implemented in PCIbex (Zehr & Schwarz, 2018). I am not affiliated with PCIbex or WebGazer.js. The script is most recently tested in PCIbex 2.0.  The calibration procedure in this newer version of PCibex is slightly different than described in the paper. However, the underlying logic of the calibration is similar. I cannot garantuee that I will maintain the script up-to-date to be used in the later versions of PCIbex. Nevertheless, if you have any questions or spot any bugs, please get in touch via <mieke.slim@ugent.be>, and I will see whether I can make the time to troubleshoot.
