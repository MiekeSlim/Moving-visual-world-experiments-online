# Moving visual world experiments online? 

Experiment scripts accompanying the paper *Moving visual world experiments online? A web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck (2017) using `PCIbex` and `WebGazer.js`* by Mieke Sarah Slim and Robert J. Hartsuiker.

Note that there are two branches in this repository: One for the fixation task (Experiment 1 in the paper) and one for the web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck's experiment (Experiment 2 in the paper). You can easily import the files of each experiment into the PCIbex Farm by syncing one of the branches in the Farm ([see the how-to on the PCIbex website](https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/github/). 

This experiment is programmed and implemented in *PennController for IBEX* (*PCIbex*, Zehr & Schwarz, 2018). Be sure to check out their [documentation](https://doc.pcibex.net/). See also PCIbex' how-to guide on [collecting eye tracking data](https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/collecting-eyetracking-data/), which provides instruction on how to set up a server for data collection.
