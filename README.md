# Experiment 2: Replication of Dijkgraaf et al.'s (2017) visual world experiment

This branch contains all the scripts and resources needed to implement Experiment 2 of the paper *Moving visual world experiments online? 
A web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Ducyk (2017) using PCIbex and WebGazer.js*. This expriment is a replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck's (2017) visual world experiment. The aim of this experiment is to test predictive processing at the verb in English sentence comprehension. The participants passively listen to sentences while they look at four images, arranged in the four quadrants of the display. 

I am not affiliated with PCIbex or WebGazer.js. For a tutorial on how to program a visual world experiment in PCIbex and how to collect eye-tracking data with PCIbex, please see [the how-to guide on the PCIbex website](https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/collecting-eyetracking-data/). In fact, much of the script of this repository is adapted from PCIbex' sample script. 

This script is most recently tested in PCIbex 2.0. I cannot garantuee that I will maintain the script up-to-date to be used in the later versions of PCIbex. Nevertheless, if you have any questions or spot any bugs, please get in touch via <mieke.slim@ugent.be>, and I will see whether I can make the time to troubleshoot.
