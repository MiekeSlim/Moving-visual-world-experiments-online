# Moving visual world experiments online? 

Experiment scripts accompanying the paper *Moving visual world experiments online? A web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck (2017) using `PCIbex` and `WebGazer.js`* by Mieke Sarah Slim and Robert J. Hartsuiker.

Note that there are two branches in this repository: One for the fixation task (Experiment 1 in the paper) and one for the web-based replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck's experiment (Experiment 2 in the paper). You can easily import the files of each experiment into the PCIbex Farm by syncing one of the branches in the Farm (https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/github/). 

If you would like to know more about how to use PCIbex and WebGazer.js to collect eye-tracking data online, be sure to check out the tutorials on the PCIbex website: https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/collecting-eyetracking-data/ (Zehr & Schwarz, 2018).
