// Experiment code for Slim & Hartsuiker's Experiment 2
// Author: Mieke Sarah Slim

// This expriment is a replication of Dijkgraaf, Hartsuiker, and Duyck's (2017) visual world experiment. 
// The participants passively listen to sentences while they look at four images, arranged in the four quadrants of the display.

// Please note that this script requires some understanding of how PCIbex works.
// If you want to use this script, it is highly recommended to first study the PCIbex documentation, go through both the basic and advanced tutorials, and study the how-to guide on collecting eye tracking data written by the PCIbex developers (all avalable on https://doc.pcibex.net/).

PennController.ResetPrefix(null) // Shorten command names (keep this)
PennController.DebugOff() // Don't show the debug window

// Resources are hosted on a distant server. 
// NOTE: It is highly recommended to store the resources in ZIP files (https://doc.pcibex.net/how-to-guides/managing-resources/). Unfortunately, the UGent servers do not allow this functionality.

We will test in a moment whether the experiment works for you.
